DESCRIPTION: 
This Arduino code blinks an LED connected to pin 9 on and off with a 500-millisecond interval.

1. Variable Definition:
   - int input = 9; – Defines input as pin 9.

2. Setup Function:
   - pinMode(input, OUTPUT); – Sets pin 9 as an output.

3. Loop Function:
   - digitalWrite(input, HIGH); – Turns the LED on by setting pin 9 to high voltage.
   - delay(500); – Waits for 500 milliseconds.
   - digitalWrite(input, LOW); – Turns the LED off by setting pin 9 to low voltage.
   - delay(500); – Waits for another 500 milliseconds.

The LED will blink on and off every second.

CODE:
int input = 9;
void setup(){
pinMode(input, OUTPUT);
}
void loop(){
digitalWrite(input,HIGH);
delay(500);
digitalWrite(input,LOW);
delay(500);
